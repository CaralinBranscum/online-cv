      - role: Doctoral Candidate
        time: 2020 - Present
        company: University of Nebraska at Omaha
        details: |
            - Managed a team of eight students and faculty research staff to collect, 
            develop, and analyze a novel database of criminal justice case processing 
            information from numerous departments/agencies. The database was used to 
            develop cohesive information on sexual assault cases as part of a 
            National Institute of Justice research grant (NIJ 2019-MU-MU-0095).
            - Contributed to novel research in collaboration with faculty, 
            working on all aspects of the research process, from data collection 
            to analysis to dissemination. 
            This resulted in eight peer-reviewed publications on various victimology/victimization issues 
            in high-impact journals and several presentations to local and national venues.
            - Awarded $10,000 in internal grant funding to conduct independent research on child victimization. 
            Research is ongoing and has resulted in the publication of a peer-reviewed article in Victims and Offenders, 
            a roundtable, and two technical reports.
